# Hitchhickers Guide 2 `asciidoctor` - {{page.title}}

## Why `asciidoctor`

Textbased text formating and highlighting footnote:dac[documentation as code] is a well known approach.
Manpages, SGML and Latex are one of the first projects started during ???
More modern projects are Markdown, ReStructured-Text and Asciidoc.

Asciidoctor is the reincarnation of the asciidoc syntax but supported by a broad varety of programming languages:

- ruby [rb]
- javascript [js]
- java [j]

footnote:[Other languages are partialy supported see python, rust and more]

The idea is to use simple text with special markup to generate contend in different output formats.

Namely:
- HTML (including responsive pages)
- (and HTML Presentations on bespoke.js or revealJS)
- PDF
- Manpages
- Docbook
- Latex
- EPUB
- ...

Combined with other tools it is easily one powerfull tool for your tool-box you will never what to miss.
